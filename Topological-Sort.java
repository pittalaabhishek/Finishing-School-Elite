/*
EA Sports, developed a video game. They designed a game in such a way that, 
there are L number of levels from 1 to L. There are D number of dependencies
where each dependency[m] = [ Xm, Ym ], represents a prerequisite relationship,
that is, in order to play level-Ym, you must have completed the level-Xm.

In one day you can complete any number of levels as long as you 
have completed all the prerequisites levels in the game. 

You cannont play a level-Ym which has some prerequisite level-Xm on same day.

Write a method to return the minimum number of days to complete all the levels
in the game. If there is no way to complete all the levels, return -1.


Input Format:
-------------
Line-1: An integer L, number of levels.
Line-2: An integer D, number of dependencies.
Next D lines: Two space separated integers, Xm and Ym.

Output Format:
--------------
An integer, the minimum number of days to complete all the levels in the game.


Sample Input-1:
---------------
3
2
1 3
2 3

Sample Output-1:
----------------
2

Explanation-1:
--------------
On the first day, levels 1 and 2 are completed. 
On the second day, level-3 is completed.


Sample Input-2:
---------------
3
3
1 2
2 3
3 1

Sample Output-2:
----------------
-1

Explanation-2:
-------------
No level can be completed because they depend on each other.*/
